# Cheetah-Rabbit-Simulation
Pathfinding/Graph search exploration. Coursework for year 2 "Algorithms and Data Structures".

Implemented various data structures and algorithms (including A*) on a grid. 

There are two main entities, a cheetah and a rabbit. The goal is for the rabbit to reach it's rabbit hole, whilst the cheetah attempts to catch the rabbit.

Executable jar files are contained in each part.
